# A Dockerfile for using the ACTS tracking toolkit

This Dockerfile is intended as a way to quickly get started with [ACTS](
https://acts.web.cern.ch/ACTS/).

You can build a Docker image from it using "docker build .", or you can use the pre-built hgrasland/acts-tests images on the public Docker Hub.
