# A dockerfile for using the Verrou plugin to Valgrind

This Dockerfile is intended as a way to quickly get started with [Verrou](https://github.com/edf-hpc/verrou).

You can build a Docker image from it using "docker build .", or you can use the pre-built hgrasland/verrou-tests image on the public Docker Hub.

It also serves as a sort of reference documentation to the Verrou build process.
