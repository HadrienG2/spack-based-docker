# A Dockerfile for working on the ACTS test framework

This Dockerfile provides a pre-built development environment for working with
the [ACTS](https://acts.web.cern.ch/ACTS/) test framework.

You can build a Docker image from it using "docker build .", or you can use the pre-built hgrasland/acts-framework-tests image on the public Docker Hub.
